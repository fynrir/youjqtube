# youJQtube

The youJQtube project is a school assignment with the intention to learn some git, how to use github
and how to use packagist and composer to create our own packages for inclusion in "frameworks".

I named it youJQtube as it involves jQuery and youtube.
The name might be a bit misleading. :P

The intention of this particular repo (and it's packagist package) is to provide the ability to create
div's on the webpage that contains a iframe with the Youtube media player implemented.

The two main features of this is it's jQuery part. Which enables you to resize the 
div and in essence the Youtube player in it. And to move the div around on the webpage.
